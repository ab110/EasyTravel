# Project Description

1. Purpose: The application simplifies traveling by asking question to the user and give them option/package to manage transportation, hotel and other expenses. So the purpose of this application is to “Simplifying Traveling with Friends and Family”. 

2. How It Will Be Used: It gives the user a few question about their preferred time, place and other traveling questions, and gives them AirBnB, Google Flights and other information as travel package (which they can also customize), so that they can manage everything about their traveling all in one place. 

3. Primary Users: People who love to travel, especially in groups, but don’t want to go through the hassle of booking tickets in different platforms and managing finance among the travel group.


# Project 03 Extension

1. Modularization: We modularized our application. Our backend is in a separate folder. We have each views in their independent Components with their individual jsx and css.

2. Routing: We added routers to the application for all the views.

3. Third Party Library:
	d3.js: This is a Javascript library for creating dynamic data visualization in web browsers. We used it to add design to some of the components of our web page. For example, we added design to circles we added to the top and bottom of the page to give our website a more full look.

4. Bootstrap: We made a lot of change using bootstrap to make it visually more appealing and user friendly.

5. Third Party API:
	Geolocation: We added a small feature on every page which a user can use to find their Current Location (it takes a few seconds to get the location after clicking the button).

These are some of the extensions we came up with. We are no way near our goal website, but we have set up the website in a way that we can extend to build that, given that we have more time and people to work on it.
